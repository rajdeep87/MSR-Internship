>> A result of Underapproximate query (if unsat) never leads to extending any call site. 
It is always followed by an over-approximate query. So, underapproximation query (if satisfiable) 
is always used for earlier bug detection. However, for safe programs, underapproximate queries 
are an overhead since it increases Z3 query as well as leads to frequent Pops which is expensive.

>> Safe Boogie program: If every path in the program is non-blocking with respect to the global variable assertPassed, 
that is, if a boogie program returns from main, then it is safe. 
   Unsafe Boogie program: If there exists some path in the program which is blocking with respect to the variable 
   assertPassed, that is, assertPassed = true and assume !assertPassed is reached through this path, then the 
   program is unsafe.

Findinds:
1> Baseline approach is always over-approximate (Good for safe cases) -- Or every 10th query is an Under-approximate query.

Query: SI algorithm may either return from an SAT Under-aproximate query or UNSAT over-approximate query. 
However, if an Under-approximate query is UNSAT and this query did not contain any blocking procedure calls, 
then SI algorithm can also return proving program as SAFE. This is demonstrated in test\regression\test1

Akash Reply: True. It would save us one less inlining. 


########## Meeting with Vincent #################
Cloud build -- Visual Studio code
Bash and batch -- if cygwin is configured correctly -- 

Build configurations
1> nmake -- just like make 
2> MS build configurations -- Through Visual Studio (API)
3> MSDN -- C# maps are called dictionary


############### Running SDV regression using Corral #####################

Results from Corral: Verification output : Correct means full verification, Proof means bounded verification.

Flags to be used with Corral present in the following file:
SdvBench/ITP_WDM/file_map.txt

Old SDV results in following file:
/MSR-Research/corral/SDV-regression/results.txt

Command line flag interpretation for Corral:
============================================
/k is the context-switch bound (does not matter for sequential programs)
/useProverEvaluate is how the Z3 model is queried for values of variables
/sdv controls the outer loop for corral. It simplifies a bunch of things knowing that the input came from SDV

TODO:
1> Run Akash's backtracking search with Buggy and Correct procedures - With and without Houdini. 
2> Run debugger to see the execution of the backtrack search
3> Write a proposal for Degree of freedom in the original algorithm


IMPLEMENTATION:
* Change the outer Hierarchical refinement loop and set it to MAX


Queries:
1> Does /newStratifiedInlining:split always have to be run with /di /doNotUseLabels option ?
2> Why does /newStratifiedInlining:split /di start with Over-approx and not Under-approx ?

Akash Response:
The SplitSearch implementation requires the /di flag, but only because it needs the call tree data structure that DI maintains. It doesn't do dag inlining

TODO: 
Figure out the VC for MustReach basic block for single procedure and for inter-precedural calls.
MustReach can be done at the level of basic blocks as well as call site. 


       Implementation
===========================
> Functions to look for -- private StratifiedVC Expand(StratifiedCallSite scs, string name, bool DoSubst, bool dontMerge)
> Look at Subhajit code for Parallelization infrastructure

Parallelization infrastructure
===============================
It is easier to use the thread pool provided by the .NET Framework through the ThreadPool class. 
https://www.dotnetperls.com/threadpool
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3dasc8as(v=vs.80).aspx
https://www.codeproject.com/articles/548865/create-a-custom-threadpool-in-csharp

Query:
1> How do we create a new Z3 instance in every thread. 
If I create this instance and then invoke the inlined procedure, does the push and pop inside that procedure uses this z3 instance ?
Should I pass ProverInterface or StratifiedInlining object to create separate VC generation data structures and separate prover instances. 
The signature of the method is : ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(Compute_FwdNoUnder, prover1);
2> What is the object when we call push(); Does it only push prover.assert() statements. 

3> Why do Corral need to expand foo() and bar() even though none of them modifies x. 
In this case, the inlining is not property based. However, if the statement "x=1;assert x!= 1"
is before the call to foo() and bar(), then corral can successfully prove it unsafe without ]
expanding foo and bar.

 
procedure top()
modifies z;
{
   z := 1;
}

procedure foo()
modifies z,y;
{
   y := 1;
   call top();
}

procedure bar()
modifies z;
{
   z := 1;
   call top();
}


procedure {:entrypoint} main()
modifies x,y,z;
{
   call foo();
   call bar();
   x := 1;
   assert x !=  1;
}


Meeting on 18th August
======================
1> Run _fail cases with SI and split-search and report number of procedures inlined and time taken 
2> Give high level algorithm to Akash and Subhajit
High level algorithm
=====================
 pick c in Calltree
 EnqueueJob(mustReach, c)
 execute block(c)
 result = continue SI
 if(result == UNSAT) 
   Dequeue job from Queue and work on it.  

3> The aim is NOT to reduce the total number of inlinings, but to split the z3 query using 
threading.  Compared to normal SI, the split search always has simplied z3 queries. 

4> In UNSAFE cases, the normal SI always does FULL inlining of all procedure calls.
5> Push in z3 is like backtracking point.

Inform Akash
=============
Decisions are made during the run of the Stratified Inlining and not upfront. 


Interesting cases in Splitsearch that requires new heuristics
==============================================================
fdc_fail_irqliopassive1_0.bpl	385203	21672.76	safe	1355.62
				
fdc_fail_irqliopassive2_0.bpl		timeout 		2084.63
				
fdc_fail_irpprocessingcomplete_0.bpl	1232	2120.2	safe	2084.63

A splitting that does not lead to significant speed-up is due to the fact that 
there is not much concurrency to exploit. For example, when a split happens, it 
immediately leads to the UNSAT for the blocking query for example. Hence, the critical 
path still is complex to solve.

Discussion with Subhajit
=========================
start procedure -- VerifyImplementation
useConcurrentSolver -- check the flag for concurrent (parallel2) or normal SI
VerifyImplementationConcurrent and VerifyImplementationSI share some methods like VC generation
public VerifyResult SolvePartition // in stratifiedInlining.cs
solver.Solve -- creates threads, 
ConcurrentState -- methods inlined, 
Each partition has its own SI state, create verificationState with its own copy of SI state 
One to one mapping between thread to its prover
public class ProverStackBookkeeping -- maintains prover, how much I need to pop, 
Blocked decision got expanded further 
Everytime I solve a partition, it figures out what are the ancester partitions 
One call tree that is being expanded -- A subtree is one partition -- every split decision creates two child partition -- 
tree of soft partition -- leaf of softpartition tree will be enqueued in the hierarchicalqueue (worklist)
Solve a softpartition -- constriants belong 
Every pop in prover corresponds to popping all context that belongs to inlined tree of softpartition
Push the software partition of 1 - do split - take another prover -- 
Dump everything to prover pool -- 
proverInstance two separate -- 
Dont pass the "newStratifiedInlining:parallel2"
>> Try with a small switch-case program with call to various functions -- check what different splitting heuristic is doing ?

Investigation of new heuristic versus old heuristic and conventional SI
========================================================================
Ran on a simple if-else program with recursionBound = 100. 
var x,y,z: int;

procedure top()
 modifies x;
 
 {
   
   x := x + 1;

}


procedure foo()

modifies x,y;

{
   y := 1;
   
call top();

}


procedure 
bar()

modifies x,z;

{
  
 z := 1;
   
 call top();

}



const N: int;

axiom 0 <= N;

procedure {:entrypoint} main() returns (result: int)

modifies x;
 
{
   
 var count: int;
   
 x := 0;
   
 count := 0;
   
 while (count < N) 
     
  invariant count <= N;
   
 {
     
  count := count + 1;
     
  result := count;
    
 
 if (result <= 50) {
 
      call foo();
     
  }
 
  else if (result > 50) {

       call bar();
     
  }

}
   
assert(count >= N);
   
assert(x == N);  
   
//assert(false);

}

(must reach at least one of them in other set). 

2> Create the perfect heuristic example. 

Link to rse server benchmarks
=============================
\\rse-server-11\sdvbench\data

Running from rse-server-16 
==========================
The top-level script exist in the foler t-ramuk/Sdvbench/runsi
C:\t-ramuk\sdvbench>binaries2\RunParServer.exe runsi.xml
Step 1> always copy the new corral to server-16/c:/t-ramuk/sdvbench/corral
The regression files are in t-ramuk/Sdvbench/data/si_files_nohoudini
The results are stored in t-ramuk/Sdvbench/results 
The logfiles are stored in t-ramuk/Sdvbench/SI where SI is the name of the utility

Change the name of the file in the runsi.xml script as follows. 
 <Files value="data\si_files_nohoudini\1394diag_completerequest_0.bpl"/>

The function that parses the output of corral to produce the results.txt file is “parseOutput”. 
It is there in CommonLib\Utils.cs. The comment says that the output format is this:
// corral time, houdini time, SI time, Procs Inlined, Stack depth, Refinements, Outcome
