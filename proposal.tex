\section{Termination in Corral}
Currently, Corral terminates in either of the following two conditions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Satisfiable Under-approximate query proving that the program has bugs.
\item Unsatisfiable Over-approximate query proving that the program is safe.
\end{enumerate}

Additionally, the procedure can also terminate if one of the following two conditions holds true.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Unsatisfiable Under-approximate query given that the query does not contain any blocking call sites.
\item Satisfiable Over-approximate query given that the query does not contain any blocking call sites.
\end{enumerate}

The above optimisation would save us one solver query.
